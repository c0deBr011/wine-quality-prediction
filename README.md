# Wine Quality Prediction

This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict wine quality using chemical properties of wine.

## Project Overview
- Dataset contains chemical features of wine samples
- Target variable is wine quality
- Problem converted into binary classification:
  - Quality >= 7 → Good Wine
  - Quality < 7 → Bad Wine

## Steps Performed
- Data understanding and inspection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Model training and comparison
- Pipeline creation and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
